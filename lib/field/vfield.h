 *  \class vfield vfield.h "lib/vfield.h"
 *  \brief Vector field class to store and operate on vector fields
 *
 *  The class stores vector fields in the form of three instances of the field class defined in <B>field.h</B>.
 *  The vector field is stored in such a way that the components are face-centered, with:
 *      - x-component located at the face centers along the yz-plane
 *      - y-component located at the face centers along the zx-plane
 *      - z-component located at the face centers along the xy-plane
 *
 *  The vector field is also equipped with a divergence operator, which returns a scalar field (sfield).
 *  However, this operation returns only cell-centered scalar field as output as most scalar fields are stored at
 *  cell centers.
 *  Moreover, the \f$ (\mathbf{u}.\nabla)\mathbf{v} \f$ operator is also provided as the function <B>computeNLin</B>
